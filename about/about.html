        <h3>This is a project called "Odin-recipes" from TheOdinProject.</h3>
        <h4>This is the second time I doing the same project. I progress the foundation "The box model" before and temporaily stopped due to school exams</h4>
        <h4>When I got back into the "Odin project" I thought may be it's a good idea to strat from the basics again.</h4>
        <h4>I have a little bit experience with HTML and CSS before.</h4>
        <h4>All 5 recipes in here are copied(not inspired, literally copied) from <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/">foodnetwork.com</a></h4>
