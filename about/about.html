            <h2>This is a project called "Odin-recipes" from TheOdinProject.</h2>
            <h3>This is the second time I doing the same project. I progress the foundation "The box model" before and temporaily stopped due to school exams</h3>
            <h3>When I got back into the "Odin project" I thought may be it's a good idea to strat from the basics again.</h3>
            <h3>I have a little bit experience with HTML and CSS before.</h3>
            <h3>All five recipes in here are copied(not inspired, literally copied) from <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/">foodnetwork.com</a></h3>
